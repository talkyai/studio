# TalkyAI Studio â€” Release Notes (v0.2.0)

**Release Date:** August 14, 2025

This release focuses on improving plugin runtime stability, enhancing UI plugin loading, and providing a better developer experience (DX) for plugin authors. A demo plugin has been added, showcasing all supported UI placements and types.

- **Cross-platform support** (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **All data and keys remain stored locally**

## Key Changes & New Features

### 1) Plugins: Runtime Stability
- Fixed infinite re-renders: `getSnapshot` now caches results and returns a stable empty reference (prevents *"Maximum update depth exceeded"* in React)
- Updated `usePluginUI` to use `useSyncExternalStore` with a shared empty constant (no mutations)

### 2) Plugins: Improved Frontend Loading
- Added compatibility for Tauri command `plugins_get_frontend_code` parameters
- Expanded fallback paths for dev-mode UI plugin loading
- Improved console diagnostics for failed loading attempts

### 3) Plugins: Host-Provided React
- The host now provides React via `TalkyAPI.React`
- Updated the demo plugin to use `TalkyAPI.React`

### 4) Plugins: New UI Capabilities
- Added support for `kind: 'dropdown'`
- `dropdown` rendering now supported in all placements

### 5) New Demo Plugin
- Added `example/ui-placements-demo` with:
  - Complete `metadata.json` example
  - Implementation for all UI types and placements
- Can run directly from `example` folder

### 6) Other Improvements
- UI/UX: Minor settings fixes
- Docs: Added `LICENSE.md`

## Fixed Issues
- Plugin UI reactive update loop
- UI plugin loading errors
- Dynamic import issues

## Breaking Changes
- Plugin authors must use `TalkyAPI.React` instead of direct React imports
- New structure required for `dropdown` UI elements

## Upgrade Guide
1. **Plugin Authors:**
  - Migrate to `TalkyAPI.React`
  - Verify `metadata.json` configuration

2. **Developers:**
  - New dev paths available for testing

## Known Limitations
- Bundle size warnings remain (non-critical)
