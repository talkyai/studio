## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a vulnerability, please report it responsibly using the process below.

- Contact: ctapu4ok91@gmail.com
- Subject: "Security report: TalkyAI Studio"
- Include: a detailed description, steps to reproduce, potential impact, affected version(s)/platform(s), and any suggested mitigations. Proof-of-concept code and logs are helpful.

What to expect:
- Acknowledgement: within 3 business days.
- Triage: we will assess severity and scope and may request additional information.
- Remediation: for valid reports, we will work on a fix and aim to release patches as soon as possible (timeline depends on complexity and impact).
- Disclosure: we prefer coordinated disclosure. We will credit reporters who request attribution once a fix is available and users have had a reasonable time to update.

Please do not create public issues for unpatched vulnerabilities. If the report concerns a third-party dependency, we may coordinate with the upstream project.

Thank you for helping keep TalkyAI Studio and its users safe.
